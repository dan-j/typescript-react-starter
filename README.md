# typescript-react-starter

Simple Typescript/React starter with Webpack 2 and hot module reloading.

To build the project run

    npm run build

This will output `index.html` and `bundle.js` to `./dist`, which can be served however you deem appropriately.

The project is also set up with `webpack-dev-server`, which can run a server for development. Simply run

    npm start

Enjoy.
